// We setup the main Angular model that we will use for our application
// Good Angular practice is to organize your code in different modules, 
// for instance, one module per feature. However, since our App is
// simple we will keep all the code in the "dinnerPlanner" module
//
// Notice the 'ngRoute' and 'ngResource' in the module declaration. Those are some of the core Angular
// modules we are going to use in this app. If you check the index.html you will
// also see that we included separate JavaScript files for these modules. Angular
// has other core modules that you might want to use and explore when you go deeper
// into developing Angular applications. For this lab, these two will suffice.
var projectApp = angular.module('projectApp', ['ngRoute','ngResource','ui.sortable']);


// Here we configure our application module and more specifically our $routeProvider. 
// Route provider is used to tell angular to load a specific partial (view) for an individual
// specific address that is provided in the browser. This enables us to change the browser address
// even if we are not reloading the page. We can also use back and forward button to navigate between
// our screens. The paths that you use in the conditions of $routeProvider will be shown in the address
// bar after the # sign. So, for instance, the home path will be 'http://localhost:8000/#/home'.
//
// In index.html you will notice the <div ng-view></div> tag. This is where the specific view sill be
// loaded. For instance when you go to http://localhost:8000/, since your path does not match any
// of the when conditions, the otherwise condition is triggered and tells the app to redirect to '/home'.
// The '/home' condition then loads the 'partials/home.html'. 
//
// Apart from specifying the partial HTML that needs to be loaded with your app, you can also specify which
// controller should be responsible for that view. In the controller you will setup the initial data or 
// access the data from the model and create the methods that you will link to events. Remember, controllers 
// can be nested, so you can have one controller responsible for the whole view, but then another one for 
// some sub part of the view. In such way you can reuse your controller on different parts of the view that 
// might have similar logic.
//
// In some cases we want the path to be variable (e.g. contain the dish id). To define the variable part of 
// the path we use the ":" sign. For instance, our '/dish/:dishId' will be triggered when we access 
// 'http://localhost:8000/#/dish/12345'. The 12345 value will be stored in a dishId parameter, which we can
// then access through $routeParams service. More information on this in the dishCtrl.js
